##Hardware architecture

To get some sense of the basic workings of a computer we need to define a few terms:

  
  * Input Devices: Provide the computer with access to outside instructions (inputs), such as from keyboard, mouse and touch screen.

  * Output devices: Provide the computer with capacity to reproduce the result of the instruction to the outside (outputs)  such screen, speakers, printer, DVD burner, etc.

  
  * Printed circuit board (PCB): The wires are all printed on this printed circuit board. PCB includ the CPU and the mother board.

  * Mother board: It's the mother of all boards. It connects all the components together as they plug-in to the PCB, transporting information across hardware.

  * Central Porcessing Unit (CPU): A highly sophisticated calculator with lots of storage made up of resistors, transistors, capacitors, and then wires in a PCB. It runs over three billion set of electrical pulses (instructions) per second, maybe 32 or 64 little wires. These instractuons are feed from the Main memory as part of the the fetch-execute cycle. The transistors can make really simple yes/no decisions. If you hook together the right way they can also store a little bit of information. 

  * Machine language:  The instructions that the CPU uses are a series of zeroes and ones (derived from the transistor limitations). So 32 or 64 zeroes and ones are fed into the CPU for each of the instructions. These instructions are called machine language. Highe level languages like Python, do not require understanding of machine language, as they are translated by a compiler or an interpreter.
  
  * Main memory (RAM): fast small temporary storage which is lost on reboot. It load information from the secondary memory and feeds it to the CPU for processing.

  * Software: data and instructions

  * Secondary Memory: slower large permanent storage, which lasts until deleted. Stores program files permanently and loads and translates them into the faster main memory. 
  These include storage devices such as disk drives, a actual physical spinning platter of magnetic media (going extinct). Secondary storage is becoming less relevant as hardware is moving to solid-state storage, like the kind of storage that's in a USB stick.
