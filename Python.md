# Introduction to Python

## Why Python?

Python was conceived by Guid Van Rosson. What started as an hobby project, soon became a general purpose programming language. 
Nowadays, Python can be used to buold practically any piece of software. This happaned because Python is open Source and Free! 
Also, it is very easy to build packages in Python. Thougout time, more and more of these packages were specifically build for data science.
Currently, there are two versions of Python, 2.X and 3.X. They are pretty similar appart from some syntactical differences, 
but support for version 2 will fade overtime. Python 3 can be installed from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads)


## The Python Interface

Python can be run interactively from the python shell. Apart from interactively, Python can also be run from python scripts,
which are simply text files with the extention .py, where a list of python commands are written and from where they are executed.
Putting the code in Pyton scrips instead of manually typing it ineratively 
will help to keep structure ansd avoid retyping everything if one change is required


print()
