# Notes for Data Science

A data scientist needs to have the programming skills to be able to acquire and manage large data sets, the statistical skills to extract value from those data, and the business skills to effectively present that value to an audience. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that unifies statistics, data analysis, machine learning methods, processes, 
algorithms and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms.
