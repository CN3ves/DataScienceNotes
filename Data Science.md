# Day 1

Here’s what you can expect over the next 7 days:

  * First, you’ll get a bird's-eye view of applied machine learning.

We’ll clear up some common misconceptions and explain how to succeed in this field.  

  * Then, we’ll spend a few days on critical (yet often overlooked) steps such as exploratory analysis, data cleaning, and feature engineering.
  * Next, we’ll discuss effective ML algorithms and exactly how to train professional-grade models.

We’ll share current industry best practices.

  * Finally, we’ll give you a step-by-step action plan for building real-world skills that will open exciting career opportunities for you.

Do you like how this sounds?

Awesome!

Here's what I need you to do now to get you started...

Here’s what we recommend for making the most out of this crash course…
 

 * Try (your best) to keep up.

We know you may be super busy, so each lesson is concise, and can be read in ~15 minutes. 

However, because the lessons build on each other, staying on schedule helps solidify the concepts.
 

  * Don’t sweat the details (for now).

We’ve seen students master this subject 2X faster by first understanding how all the pieces fit together… and then diving deeper.

Our trainings follow this “top-down” approach.
 

  * Don’t worry about coding (yet).

Again, it’s easy to get lost in the weeds at the beginning… so our goal is to see the forest instead of the trees.

Don’t worry - We’ll get to the code later.

With that, let's get started with lesson 1, which will introduce you to the framework we'll build upon:

# Day 2 

Yesterday, you got a high-level overview of the entire machine learning workflow.

We're already laying a strong foundation.

But before we continue...

...there’s a big challenge in data science that we must address…

...and it’s called “Tactical Hell.”

This is actually a term from startups, and it’s when you have too many tactics to choose from.

Should you develop your product more? Invest in marketing? Hire an accountant? Etc.

In many ways, training a ML model is like growing a startup. You also have too many tactics to choose from.

Should you clean your data more? Engineer features? Test new algorithms? Etc.

There’s a lot of trial and error...

...and you often need to figure it out along the way!

So how do you avoid wasting time chasing dead ends?

Well, that’s the topic of today’s lesson :-)

Today, we're going to dive into the first step of the core machine learning workflow:

Exploratory Analysis.

That’s just a fancy term for “getting to know” your data.

Doing this upfront is the best way to save time and avoid wild goose chases…

Remember, you are a commander with LIMITED resources.

Exploratory analysis is sending your scouts ahead to learn where best to deploy your forces!

Here’s our framework for doing so quickly, efficiently, and decisively:

 # Day 3
 Yesterday, you saw some quick data visualizations for "getting to know" your dataset…

Today, you’ll learn how to clean it into tip-top shape.

You see, proper data cleaning is the “secret” sauce behind machine learning…

Well, it’s not really a “secret”…

...it’s just a bit boring, so no one really talks about it.

But the truth is:

Better data beats fancier algorithms…

Garbage in = Garbage out...

Plain and Simple!

If you have a clean dataset, even simple algorithms can learn impressive insights from it!

(Even if you forget everything else from this course, please remember this point)

Now, as you might imagine...

...Different problems will require different methods…

For now though, let’s at least ensure we know how to fix the most common issues.

Here’s a checklist you can always use as a reliable starting point, regardless of your dataset:

# Day 4
Pretty nice, let's keep going...

...lots of great stuff to get to in the second half!

Yesterday, you learned a reliable framework for cleaning your dataset…

Today, in day 4 of our 7-day crash course, we're going to discuss “feature engineering.”

In a nutshell, feature engineering is the process of creating new features from your existing ones.

That doesn’t sounds like much…

…Yet Andrew Ng, former head of Baidu AI and Google Brain, said:

“Coming up with features is difficult, time-consuming, requires expert knowledge.
‘Applied machine learning’ is basically feature engineering.”

Wow!

Absolutely no pressure, right?

So why is it so difficult and time-consuming?

To start, feature engineering is very open-ended. There are literally infinite options for new features to create.

Plus, you’ll need domain knowledge to add informative features instead of just more noise.

This is a skill that you’ll develop naturally with time and practice, but you can give yourself a big head-start if you have a framework in place.

A feature engineering framework simply consists of "heuristics" that you can rely on to spark ideas.

If you're a beginner, heuristics can help you know where to start looking... and if you're experienced, heuristics can help you get unstuck.

In today’s lesson, we’ve compiled our favorites:
[Go to Lesson 4: Feature Engineering](https://elitedatascience.com/feature-engineering)

# Day 5
Yesterday, you learned several different heuristics to inspire ideas for feature engineering.

Today, we're going to dive into Algorithm Selection.

In this lesson, we'll introduce 5 very effective machine learning algorithms for regression.

They each have classification counterparts as well.

And yes, just 5 for now!

Instead of giving you a long list of algorithms...

...our goal is to explain a few essential concepts (e.g. regularization, ensembling, automatic feature selection) that will teach you why some algorithms tend to perform better than others.

In applied machine learning, individual algorithms should be swapped in and out depending on which performs best for the problem and the dataset.

Therefore, we will focus on intuition and practical benefits over math and theory.

We have two main goals for this lesson:

    To Introduce Powerful Mechanisms in Modern Machine Learning
    To Tour Several Algorithms That Use Those Mechanisms.

# Day 6

Yesterday, we introduced 5 algorithms and their underlying mechanisms.

Today, we'll look at how to systematically train effective models.

Yes, this is what you’ve been waiting for...

...at last...

...it’s time to build our models.

It might seem like it took us a while to get here...

...but professional data scientists actually spend the bulk of their time on the steps leading up to this one:

    Exploring the data.
    Cleaning the data.
    Engineering new features.

Again, that’s because better data beats fancier algorithms.

In this lesson...

...you'll learn how to maximize model performance while safeguarding against overfitting.

Plus, you'll learn how to automatically find the best parameters for each algorithm.

We'll walk through an overview of each of these steps:

    Split dataset
    Decide on hyperparameters
    Set up cross-validation
    Fit and tune models
    And finally...Select a winner!

# Day 7
This is the very last day of the crash course!

We've got a very special final installment especially for you.

BTW, Nice job following along so far... we've really covered a lot of ground over the last week!

    On day 1, you saw a bird's-eye view of the entire machine learning workflow.
    Then, on day 2, you learned our framework for fast, efficient, and decisive exploratory analysis.
    Day 3 was all about data cleaning, which is perhaps the most important step of all!
    Next, on day 4, we shared our favorite heuristics for feature engineering.
    On day 5, we discussed regularization and ensembles, and you learned about 5 algorithms that leverage those mechanisms.
    And yesterday on day 6, we walked through a proven formula for training excellent models after the other steps have been completed correctly.

(Links all the lessons are included at the start of today's lesson)

Now, we'll give you our best recommendations for where to go from here...
 
...including how to transform these concepts into invaluable, practical skills that can significantly impact your career.
