```
# the code below almost works
prinq("hello world")

# Solution
print("hello world")
```


## Week 4
### In the following code, `print(98.6)`, What is "98.6"?

  * *A constant*
  * A variable
  * An iteration / loop statement
  * A conditional statement

### What does the following code print out? `print("125" + "abc")`

  * hello world
  * *123abc*
  * 123+abc
  * This is a syntax error because you cannot add strings
  
### Which of the following variables is the "most mnemonic"?

  * x
  * x1q3z9ocd
  * *hours*
  * variable_173
  
### Which of the following is not a Python reserved word?

  * *iterate*
  * continue
  * else
  * break
  
### Assume the variable x has been initialized to an integer value (e.g., x = 3). What does the following statement do? `x = x +2`

  * Increase the speed of the program by a factor of 2
  * Exit the program
  * *Retrieve the current value for x, add two to it, and put the sum back into x*
  * This would fail as it is a syntax error
  
### Which of the following elements of a mathematical expression in Python is evaluated first?

  * Addition +
  * *Parentheses ( )*
  * Multiplication *
  * Subtraction -

### What is the value of the following expression `42 % 10`. Hint - the "%" is the remainder operator

  * 4210
  * 42
  * *2*
  * 420
  
### What will be the value of x after the following statement executes: `x = 1 + 2 * 3 - 8/4`

  * 4
  * 2.0
  * 8
  * *5.0*
  
### What will be the value of x when the following statement is executed: `x = int(98.6)`

  * 6
  * 100
  * *98*
  * 99
  
### What does the Python input() function do?

  * *Pause the program and read data from the user*
  * Connect to the network and retrieve a web page.
  * Read the memory of the running program
  * Take a screen shot from an area of the screen

### Write a program that uses input to prompt a user for their name and then welcomes them. Enter Sarah in the pop-up box when you are prompted so your output will match the desired output.

**Desired Output**: Hello Sarah

```
# The code below almost works
name = input("Enter your name")
print("Howdy")

# Solution
name = input("Enter your name")
print("Hello", name)
```


### Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or bad user data.
**Desired Output**: Pay: 96.25

```
# This first line is provided for you
hrs = input("Enter Hours:")

# Solution
hrs = input("Enter Hours:")
r = input("Enter Rate:")
print('Pay:', float(hrs)*float(r)
```
